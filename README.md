### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff and I am fullstack developer at Reibase, Inc. I am currently developing our product, Solaris, which can be found at [solaris.reibase.rs](https://solaris.reibase.rs). It is a protocol to allow maintainers of code to distribute credits to their team/network which can then be used to vote on pull requests, streamlining development and incentivizing better contributions.


I am proficient in the PERN stack, functional with Docker and GraphQL, am familiar with React Native, and I love all things front end as I was an artist in a previous life.

Another project I am proud of is Fairline Defense, pinned below, which was a freelance project made from scratch for a client who needed a webapp which could: 
- ðŸ”’ Authenticate users
- ðŸ‘¤ Have a user portal where user's could update their information 
- ðŸ’³ Checkout and process subscription payments with Stripe
- ðŸ“« Send email and SMS notificiations
