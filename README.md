Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jeff and I am fullstack developer based in New York. Most recently I worked at Reibase Inc, an early stage startup backed by Techstars where I worked on our product, Solaris - a protocol to allow code maintainers to streamline development and incentivize better contributions.

As a personal project I am also developing SelectedWork, an app for visual artists to quickly create and easily maintain custom looking portfolio websites: - -- Repo: https://github.com/jex441/dash
- URL: https://selectedwork.net

A new library I am enjoying right now is React DND Kit. Having implemented some drag and drop functionality in the past, I am aware how difficult in can be to implement. So far, DND Kit is a life saver. React DND Kit
