### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff and I am fullstack developer at Reibase, Inc. I am currently developing our product, Solaris - a protocol to allow code maintainers to streamline development and incentivize better contributions. It is deployed [here](https://solaris.reibase.rs) and a sandbox project for it can be found [here](https://github.com/reibase/solaris-sandbox).

As a personal project I am also developing Selected-Work, an app for visual artists to quickly create and easily maintain custom looking websites: https://github.com/jex441/dash
