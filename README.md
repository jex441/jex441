### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff and I am fullstack developer at Reibase, Inc. I am currently developing our product, Solaris - a protocol to allow code maintainers to streamline development and incentivize better contributions. It is launched [here](https://solaris.reibase.rs) and a sandbox project for it can be found [here](https://github.com/reibase/solaris-sandbox).

I am proficient in the PERN stack, functional with Docker and GraphQL, am familiar with React Native, and I love all things front end as I was an artist in a previous life. I am currently learning Typescript because I have put it off for long enough.

Another project I worked on last year was Fairline Defense, pinned below, which was for a client who needed a webapp which could: 
- ðŸ”’ Authenticate users
- ðŸ‘¤ Have a user portal where user's could view and update their information 
- ðŸ’³ Checkout and process subscription payments with Stripe
- ðŸ“« Send email and SMS notificiations to users
