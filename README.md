Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeff, a full-stack developer based in New York, with recent experience at Reibase Inc., an early-stage, Techstars-backed startup. There, I contributed to building Solaris, a protocol designed to streamline development processes and incentivize higher-quality contributions for code maintainers.

I am also developing SelectedWork, a platform for creating custom portfolio websites:
