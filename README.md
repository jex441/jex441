### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff and I am fullstack developer at Reibase, Inc. I am currently developing our product, Solaris - a protocol to allow code maintainers to streamline development and incentivize better contributions. It is deployed [here](https://solaris.reibase.rs) and a sandbox project for it can be found [here](https://github.com/reibase/solaris-sandbox).

As a personal project I am also developing Selected-Work, an app for visual artists to quickly create and easily maintain custom looking portfolio websites: https://github.com/jex441/dash

A new library I am enjoying right now is React DND Kit. Having implemented some drag and drop functionality in the past, I am aware how difficult in can be to implement. So far, DND Kit is a life saver. [React DND Kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit)
